Getting uniformly distributed numbers on a sphere

- https://corysimon.github.io/articles/uniformdistn-on-sphere/

Sampling technique >> polygon list of countries
- take out list of countries that we don't want to >> 

communications cones for ground stations 
- means altitudes of the constellations
- how much area is the station covering 

optimization questions: 
- centroid of every single country >> optimize over the best over all countries
- extend up to the boundary of the polygon

different test cases of satellites
- capella has the inclined orbits 

heuristics of each country
- have some heuristics on 
- only place on regions that rae outside of communications cones >> update polygon at each placement

Things I need to add in 10/28/24
- the communication cones
- implement nelder mead if its not on land
- randomized points with duncan's function

# 11/11/2024 Next few objectives: IMPORTANT


Little features (should do first):
- Add in the automatic turn off method when you know itâ€™s all optimized
    - all within 50 meters of each other?
    - get centroid of polygon (and then compute distances from each point and see how it fares)
- starting locations at all most outside locations of the polygon
- gpu parallel processing
    - optimizer line 112 in gsopt
    - mpctx
    - setting up tasks in a specific manner

Other features:
- change between land masses easily when using nelder mead funciton

Things to just start reading over
- current approaches to ground station optimization methods

New experiments
- different satellite cases
    - inclined orbits vs not inclined, do ground staiton locations change
- factors to test on:
    - total data downlink?
    - total number of contacts?
    - minimum average gap time between contacts?
    - satellite constellations, how to best select networks to best optimize for revenue
    - as a GSaAS provider, how to choose best places to past revenue for moving to put gs in some place sthan others
    
- maybe to standardize, choose best location over each continent, then check which continent has best one
    - then iterate over?
    - need to add constraints on how close these stations can be to one another
- compare different points with teleport map?
    - teleports https://www.worldteleport.org/page/TeleportMap3110
    - (comparison between teleports and the potential locations for selection )


- htop
- https://woodstock.stanford.edu/citizen (checking the cpu gpu usage)

# 11/18/2024 current stuff I've done today and last week

- Kind of implemented the automatic turn off feature, the only thing is that its not converging (tried 10,000m) still not converting >> mabye closer to 100 kms?
- might be prolbem with nelder mead?
    - **I also need to print out (Very quick todo when i get back) print out all of the different converging times so that I can plot that later?**
        - can plot both centroid and distances betwen each point


- finished: gpu parallel processing > completed, tasks currently are just contacts for each point (could we optimize this further?) 
    

TODOS:
- starting locations at all most outside locations of the polygon
    - tried this but im getting into a weird palce where I don't quite get the furthest poinst away from each thing...
    - maybe we should just hand pick these points? rather than compute them every time?
- we should get the best points within the three and return that as our ground station to work with
- for cases where we keep going back and forth, not worth just letting them keep going back and forth
    - convergence cases (not converging further)
- is 100 meters good enough
- running multiple nelder meads and checking best one
    - need to practice running on cluster instead
- don't want to take points that are worse than the new one (need to check if random points are worse)
